My solutions to exercises at https://hackerrank.com.

This is my profile there: https://www.hackerrank.com/jonasraoni :)

These are my own implementations, everything should be running fast enough to pass through all tests. As I enjoy small and concise codes, whatever doesn't fit in this rule means that I've suffered or didn't have enough knowledge ðŸ˜‚

Note: Few codes were solved in C# (I've written them a long time ago), I'll convert to JS when I get some free time, just to keep the repository uniform.
